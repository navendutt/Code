                                          Estimating a Statistical Scorecard of Securities Settlement Failure
A settlement fail occurs when securities are not delivered and therefore paid for on the date originally scheduled by a buyer and seller. The transaction can be an outright sale or the starting or closing leg of a repurchase agreement. Fails are important because they expose market participants to the risk of loss in the event of counterparty insolvency. The prospect of such loss leads participants to devote resources to monitoring and controlling counterparty exposure and could, in an extreme case, lead them to limit their secondary market trading.
